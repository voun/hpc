A Computer cluster consists of many connected nodes/computers. They have no shared memory and information is sent
via message passing (MPI). Sending messages is the most expensive operation.

In a GPU there is shared memory between computational units and processing elements within a workgroup.
Can be viewed as a CPU with many cores. No explicit caching (i.e automatic datahandling for local memory within a workgroup)

1) sequential on CPU
2) parallel on CPU
